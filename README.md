> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Aurora README has been moved to the in-site GitHub Wiki tab. You can visit it [here](https://github.com/HeartOfIrons/Aurora/wiki). It contains how to **take down a script (that you own or co-own)** and **script history** instead of looking at this blank page.

> [!TIP]
> Files submitted into Aurora's repository will now be named using the following convention:
>
> **`[Game]__[ScriptAmount]`**
>
> This avoids confusion if a game is labeled with numbers, and also gives an idea of how many scripts there are for that game.
>
> I hope this doesn't cause an inconvenience.
